# Project---Real-Estate-Tycoon

This is an example of Linear Regression

Project Scope:
Our client is a large real estate investment trust (REIT). They invest in houses, appartments and condos within a small county in New York state. As a part of their business, they try to predict the fair trasaction price of a property before it's sold. They do this to caliberate their internal pricing models and keep a post on the market.


Current solution: The REIT currently uses a third party appraisal service. Appraisers are professionals who visit a property and estimate a fair price using their expertise or their own sets of metrics and checklists.Unfortunately, the skill levels of appraisers can vary greatly. The REITS compared the appraiser prices to actual transaction prices and they found that the estimates given by the inexperiences appraisers were off by $70,000 on average.

Our role:
The REIT has hired us to find a data driven approach to valueing properties. They currently have an untapped dataset for transaction prices for previous properties on the market and our goal is to build a real estate pricing model using that dataset.

Goal:
Build a model to predict transaction prices with an average error of under $70,000.


Specifics:
Machine Learning task: Regression model
Target variable: Transaction price
Input variables: Refer to data dictionary file - "Data Dictionary - Real Estate Tycoon"
Success Criteria: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) < $70,000


This project will be carried out in 4 stages
1. Exploratory Data Analysis: Data understanding and generating insights
2. Data Cleaning & Data Preparation: Preparing data for Modelling
3. Data Modelling: Experimenting with classification algorithms
4. Model Evaluation: Verifying using performance metrics
